This is a quick tutorial on how to setup and use Virtual Extruders on printers with mixing hotends such as the Geeetech A10M and A20M.  

I used Simplify3D for this tutorial because the interface showed well on camera, but because this process is mostly in the startup script, ANY slicer that supports multi-extruders will work.

The startup Gcode for this process is:
M163 S0 P1.00 ; Set Left to 100%
M163 S1 P0.00 ; Set Right to 0%
M164 S0 ; Save Mix

M163 S0 P0.00 ; Set Left to 0%
M163 S1 P1.00 ; Set Right to 100%
M164 S1 ; Save Mix

M163 S0 P0.50 ; Set Left to 50%
M163 S1 P0.50 ; Set Right to 50%
M164 S2 ; Save Mix

Etc….

Remember on the M164 command, this is the number of the extruder/Toolhead  you will assign, minus 1. i.e. S0 = Extruder 1, S1 = Extruder2,  S2 = Extruder 3 (first virtual extruder), etc.
